8. Create a flight plan by entering the project name, selecting relevant parameters, and observing other paraments changing such as flight time. Tick the “show area” region to see flight plan and flight path. Check all preflight check tick marks to enable flying. Click on the start mission button to start the survey.

10. Point cloud output settings can be set on this page by checking various boxes. Each term can be reviewed by hovering the mouse over the “i” icon in front of the parameters. And continue by clicking on the start processing icon. Proceed to the next step by clicking the bottom right arrow symbol after the point cloud is generated.
